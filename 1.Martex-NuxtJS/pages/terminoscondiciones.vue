                  <h4>3.1 Fees</h4>

                    invoice no later than thirty (14) days after the date of such invoice. If Customer has signed up
                    for automatic billing, VORTIA will charge Customer's selected payment method (such as a
                    credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in Customer's home country)
                    for any Fees on the applicable payment date, including any applicable taxes. If VORTIA cannot

                    funds), Customer remains responsible for any uncollected amounts, and VORTIA will attempt
                    to charge the payment method again as Customer may update its payment method
                    information. In accordance with local law, VORTIA may update information regarding
                    Customer's selected payment method if provided such information by Customer's financial
                    institution.

                    check, credit card, debit card, wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
                    designated by VORTIA or such other payment method mutually agreed by the Parties. All
                    payments are non-refundable and neither Party will have the right to set off, discount or
                    otherwise reduce or refuse to pay any amounts due to the other Party under this Agreement.

                    per month or, if lower, the highest rate permitted by applicable law and VORTIA may suspend
                    Services until all payments are made in full. Customer will reimburse VORTIA for all reasonable
                    costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting any late
                    payments or interest. VORTIA reserves the right to suspend the Subscription Services with
                    notice in the event of Customer non-payment of past due invoices.

                  <h4>3.3 Taxes</h4>
                  <p>
                    Customer is responsible for all sales, use, ad valorem and excise taxes, and any other similar
                    taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, multinational or local
                    governmental regulatory authority on any amount payable by Customer to VORTIA hereunder,
                    other than any taxes imposed on VORTIA's income. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
                    event that Customer is required to deduct or withhold any taxes from the amounts payable to
                    VORTIA hereunder, Customer will pay an additional amount, so that VORTIA receives the
                    amounts due to it hereunder in full, as if there were no withholding or deduction.

                  <h4>4.1 Definition</h4>
                  <p>
                    As used herein, "Confidential Information" means any information that one Party (the
                    "Disclosing Party") provides to the other Party (the "Receiving Party") in connection with this
                    Agreement, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably
                    should be considered to be confidential given the nature of the information and/or the
                    circumstances of disclosure. For clarity, the Subscription Services and the Documentation will
                    be deemed Confidential Information of VORTIA. However, Confidential Information will not
                    include any information or materials that:
                  </p>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>are at the date of disclosure, or have subsequently become, generally known or available to
                    the public through no act or failure to act by the Receiving Party;</li>
                    <li>are rightfully known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving such information or materials
                    from the Disclosing Party;</li>
                    <li>are rightfully acquired by the Receiving Party from a third party who has the right to
                    disclose such information or materials without breach of any confidentiality or non-use
                    obligation to the Disclosing Party; or</li>
                    <li>are independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without use of or access to any
                    Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4>4.2 Obligations</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Receiving Party will maintain the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information in strict
                    confidence, and will not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except as
                    necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement; provided that
                    VORTIA may use and modify Confidential Information of Customer in deidentified form for
                    purposes of developing and deriving Aggregate Data. The Receiving Party will not disclose or
                    cause to be disclosed any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, except
                  </p>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>to those employees, representatives, or contractors of the Receiving Party who have a bona
                    fide need to know such Confidential Information to perform under this Agreement and who
                    are bound by written agreements with use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective
                    as those set forth in this Agreement, or</li>
                    <li>as such disclosure may be required by the order or requirement of a court, administrative
                    agency or other governmental body, subject to the Receiving Party providing to the Disclosing
                    Party reasonable written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or
                    otherwise contest the disclosure.</li>
